Java's history is very fascinating. Although Java was initially intended for interactive television, the digital cable television business at the time could not use it due to its advanced technology. The Green Team is where Java's history began. This project was started by members of the Java team (also known as the Green Team) to create a language for digital devices like set-top boxes, televisions, etc. However, internet programming was where it excelled. Later, Netscape incorporated Java technology.

"Simple, Robust, Portable, Platform-independent, Secured, High Performance, Multithreaded, Architecture Neutral, Object-Oriented, Interpreted, and Dynamic" were the guiding concepts for developing Java programming. James Gosling, regarded as the creator of Java, began working on it in 1995. The initiative was initiated by James Gosling and his crew in the early '90s.



Why Java is one of the go to language nowadays?

The fact that Java is platform independent is one of the main factors in its popularity. As long as the computer has a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed, Java programs can operate on a variety of different computer types. 

A JRE will work with the majority of computer types, including Windows PCs, Macintosh computers, Unix or Linux systems, big mainframe computers, and mobile phones. Some of the largest organizations in the world are constructed using the language because it has been around for such a long time. Java is widely used by banks, shops, insurance companies, utilities, and manufacturers.

Steve Zara, a programmer for more than 40 years, explains how Java usage is still growing. Instead, it is a language in evolution that almost singularly balances stability and creativity. Zara emphasizes the language's durability by claiming that code created 15 years ago will still run on the most recent JVMs and benefit from the most recent advancements in memory management, native code translation, and profiling.
